# Effect-of-Feature-Count-on-Hyperparameter-Tuning-Original-Noisy-and-PCA-Reduced-Features
This repository explores how the number of features impacts hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. It demonstrates tuning using original, noisy, and PCA-reduced features with Logistic Regression, highlighting how feature count affects model complexity, regularization, and overfitting prevention.

This repository demonstrates the effect of the number of features on hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. The project covers three scenarios:
1. **Original Features**: Using the dataset with its original features.
2. **Noisy Features**: Adding noisy, irrelevant features to the dataset and observing the impact on model performance and hyperparameter tuning.
3. **PCA-Reduced Features**: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and observing the effect on hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

The project explores how the number of features, whether original, noisy, or reduced via PCA, impacts the **hyperparameter tuning process**. We use **Logistic Regression** as the model and tune its hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** to determine the best regularization and solver parameters.

### Key Concepts

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Finding the best set of hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Adding or reducing features to analyze how the number of features affects model accuracy and tuning.
- **Regularization**: Adjusting the regularization parameter to avoid overfitting, especially when dealing with noisy or high-dimensional data.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variance, making hyperparameter tuning easier and less computationally expensive.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Load and preprocess data**: Standardize the dataset to prepare it for training.
2. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Perform **GridSearchCV** to find the best hyperparameters for Logistic Regression.
3. **Evaluate the effect** of feature count on model performance and hyperparameter tuning.
